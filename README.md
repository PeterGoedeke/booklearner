# BookLearner

Repository for the BookLearner website, which can be found [here](https://booklearner.com).

One thing which has been a massive pain for me in language learning is how much time it can take to create vocabulary lists so that I can practise them (and the lack of good, easily-accessible, non-beginner vocabulary lists out there). BookLearner attempts to solve this issue by creating vocabulary lists from books and websites. Simply submit a PDF, EPUB, URL, or some plain text, and the tool will return a vocabulary list in CSV format. This CSV can then be given to Quizlet or another service to be practised or printed.
